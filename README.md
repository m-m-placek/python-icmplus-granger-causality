# Python–ICM+ Granger causality
https://github.com/m-m-placek/python-icmplus-granger-causality

This repository contains Python code for Granger causality. It is designed to be run by ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, UK, https://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk). The repository was utilised in paper [1]. To learn how to run Python code by ICM+, see paper [2].
